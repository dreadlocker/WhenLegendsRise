                    Legs are tired
                    <br> These hands are broken
                    <br> Alone I try with words unspoken
                    <br> Silent cry
                    <br> A breath is frozen
                    <br> With blinded eyes, I fear myself
                    <br>
                    <br> It's burning down
                    <br> It's burning high
                    <br> When ashes fall, the legends rise
                    <br> We burn it out a mile wide
                    <br> When ashes fall, the legends rise
                    <br>
                    <br> Throat is dry
                    <br> My vision's fading
                    <br> I'm paralysed, and left here waiting
                    <br> Taking time, just one step forward
                    <br> Won't lose my mind. I'm here to stay
                    <br>
                    <br> It's burning down
                    <br> It's burning high

                    <br> Golden visions from now on
                    <br> Can't carry you along
                    <br> No more explanations why
                    <br> I've erased the dramatized - Neutralize
                    <br>
                    <br> So let it out - Let it go
                    <br> Just spit it out straight til I'm not breathing
                    <br> Get it out - Take it all
                    <br> Just let it all find a way to be
                    <br> So let it out - Let it go
                    <br> Just spit it out straight til I'm not breathing
                    <br> Get it out - Take it all
                    <br> Just let it all find a way to be
                    <br> A way to be
                    <br>
                    <br> So let it all out, let it all go, let it out, let it all out
                    <br> So let it all out, let it all go, let it out, let it all out
                    <br> So let it all out, let it all go, let it out, let it all out
                    <br> So let it all out, let it all go, let it out, let it all out
                    <br> So let it all out

                    Let's go
                    <br>
                    <br> So down and digging - I lost myself
                    <br> But it's the last time I bloody my hands
                    <br> I'm living in vain, I never promised you a damn thing that I can't promise
                    <br> myself, and here we go! tick-tock-tick-tock...
                    <br>
                    <br> In the eye of the storm I make my stand
                    <br> But I'm not waiting for the walls to close in
                    <br> I just brace myself for winds to change their ways
                    <br> In the eye of the storm I'm making my stand
                    <br>
                    <br> With a broke down spirit you're crawlin' in the middle
                    <br> Don't you point your finger in my face
                    <br> Cuz every bad decision that you made you're living with and everyone else
                    <br> is to blame, and here we go! tick-tock-tick-tock...
                    <br>
                    <br> In the eye of the storm I make my stand
                    <br> But I'm not waiting for the walls to close in
                    <br> I just brace myself for winds to change their ways
                    <br> In the eye of the storm I'm making my stand
                    <br> Go!

                    <br> In the eye of the storm I make my stand...
                    <br> Let's go!
