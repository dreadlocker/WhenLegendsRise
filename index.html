                Legs are tied, these hands are broken
                <br> Alone I try with words unspoken
                <br> Silent cry, my breath is frozen
                <br> With blinded eyes, I fear myself!
                <br>
                <br> It's burning down, it's burning high
                <br> When ashes fall the legends rise
                <br> We burned it out oh my oh why
                <br> When ashes fall the legends rise
                <br>
                <br> My throat is dry, my vision's fading
                <br> I'm paralyzed and left here waiting
                <br> Taking time just one step forward
                <br> Won't lose my mind, I'm here to stay
                <br>
                <br> It's burning down, it's burning high

                <br> Living with these shadows separating what I've done
                <br> And chasing the illusions of who I once was
                <br> Too much time, too many places

                <br> None of which I really give a shit about anyway
                <br> Shedding all my skin to start again

                <br> I never promised you a damn thing that I can't promise myself
                <br> And here we go...
                <br>
                <br> [Pre-Chorus]

                <br> Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock
                <br>
                <br> [Chorus]

                <br> In the eye of the storm I make my stand
                <br> I'm not waiting for the walls to close in
                <br> I just brace myself for winds to change their ways
                <br> In the eye of the storm I'm making my stand
                <br>
                <br> [Verse 2]
                <br> With a broke down spirit
                <br> You're crawling in the middle
                <br> Don't you point your finger in my face
                <br> Cause every bad decision that you made
                <br> You're living with and everyone else is to blame
                <br> And here we go...
                <br>
                <br> [Pre-Chorus]

                <br> Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock
                <br>
                <br> [Chorus]

                <br> In the eye of the storm I make my stand
                <br> I'm not waiting for the walls to close in
                <br> I just brace myself for winds to change their ways
                <br> In the eye of the storm I'm making my stand
                <br> Go!
                <br>
                <br> [Guitar solo]
                <br>
                <br> [Chorus]

                <br> In the eye of the storm I make my stand
                <br> I'm not waiting for the walls to close in
                <br> I just brace myself for winds to change their ways
                <br> In the eye of the storm I make my stand
                <br> The eye of the storm I'm taking my stand
                <br> In the eye of the storm I make my stand
                <br> Let's go!
